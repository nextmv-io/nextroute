      # There appears to be a bug around
      # `nextmv-io/sdk@v1.8.0/golden/file.go:75` specifically in Windows. When
      # attempting to remove a temp file, the following error is encountered:
      # `panic: remove C:\Users\RUNNER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\output1368198263:
      # The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
      # process.` We need to figure out why it only happens in Windows. Until
      # then, we will not run the golden file tests in Windows.
