# Time dependent duration matrix (duration_matrix_time_dependent*.json)

The duration matrix time-dependent files define different duration matrices
usage scenarios where duration_matrix_time_dependent0 is the simplest one and
works as a baseline.
All other files are expected to have longer travel times due to scaling or matrices
with higher values in the time frames. An exception is file 3 which has a lower
travel time than file 0 because it splits stops on two vehicles.

* file 0: "route_travel_duration": 1380
* file 1: "route_travel_duration": 1498
* file 2: "route_travel_duration": 1950
* file 3: "route_travel_duration": 1140
