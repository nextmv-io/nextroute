# Nextroute

Welcome to Nextmv's **Nextroute**, a feature-rich Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
solver written in pure Go. Designed with a focus on maintainability,
feature-richness, and extensibility, Nextroute is built to handle real-world
applications across [all platforms that Go (cross)compiles
to](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment).

Our goal is not to compete on specific VRP type benchmarks, but to provide a
robust and versatile tool that can adapt to a variety of routing use-cases.
Whether you're optimizing the routes for a small fleet of delivery vans in a
city or managing complex logistics for a global supply chain, Nextroute is
equipped to help you find efficient solutions.

You can work with Nextroute in a variety of ways:

* Go package: Import the `nextroute` package in your Go project and use the
  solver directly.
* Python package: Use the `nextroute` Python package as an interface to the Go
  solver.

### Go

A first run can be done with the following command. Stand at the root of the
repository and run:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go -runner.input.path cmd/input.json -solve.duration 5s
```

This will run the solver for 5 seconds and output the result to the console.

In order to start a _new project_, please refer to the sample app in the
[community-apps repository](https://github.com/nextmv-io/community-apps/tree/develop/go-nextroute).
If you have [Nextmv CLI](https://www.nextmv.io/docs/platform/installation#nextmv-cli)
installed, you can create a new project with the following command:

```bash
nextmv community clone -a go-nextroute
```

### Python

A first run can be done by executing the following script. Stand at the root of
the repository and execute it:

```python
import json

import nextroute

with open("cmd/input.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

input = nextroute.schema.Input.from_dict(data)
options = nextroute.Options(SOLVE_DURATION=5)
output = nextroute.solve(input, options)
print(json.dumps(output.to_dict(), indent=2))
```

This will run the solver for 5 seconds and output the result to the console.

In order to start a _new project_, please refer to the sample app in the
[community-apps repository](https://github.com/nextmv-io/community-apps/tree/develop/python-nextroute).

nextmv community clone -a python-nextroute
```

## Local benchmarking

To run the go benchmarks locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
go test -benchmem -timeout 20m -run=^$ -count 10 -bench "^Benchmark" ./...
```

In order to compare changes from a PR with the latest `develop` version, you can
use `benchstat`.

```bash
# on the develop branch (or any other branch)
go test -benchmem -timeout 20m -run=^$ -count 10 -bench "^Benchmark" ./...\
 | tee develop.txt
# on the new branch (or any other branch)
go test -benchmem -timeout 20m -run=^$ -count 10 -bench "^Benchmark" ./...\
 | tee new.txt
# compare the two
benchstat develop.txt new.txt
```

## Versioning

We try our best to version our software thoughtfully and only break APIs and
behaviors when we have a good reason to.

* Minor (`v1.^.0`) tags: new features, might be breaking.
* Patch (`v1.0.^`) tags: bug fixes.
